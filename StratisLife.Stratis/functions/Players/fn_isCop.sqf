/*
    Function: LIFE_fnc_isCop
    
    Takes a player and returns true if they are in the cop slots.
    returns false otherwise.
    
    example: amICop = [player] call LIFE_fnc_isCop;
    amICop will be true or false.
    
    A cop member is determined by the value of the "name" field given it
    within the map. It must be called "swat_#" where "#" is a number that
    increments by 1 for each cop character. "#" should start from 1.
